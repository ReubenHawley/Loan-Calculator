<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A browser based loan calculator using javascript for the sole purpose of learning to work with and manipulate the DOM
### Built With

* [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
* [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
dependencies are called via CDN and are not modules in the program, 
thus this program requires no dependencies to be installed

### Installation

1. Clone the Loan-Calculator
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ReubenHawley/Loan-Calculator.git
   ```
2. Execute the `index.html` file to open it in the browser



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

2. User enters an interest amount into the input bar with the placeholder "Interest"
3. User enters a repayment term into the input bar with the placeholder "Years to Pay"
4. Upon clicking Calculate, a gif is loaded for UX to demonstrate processing
5. Results returned are *Monthly Payment* , *Total Payment* , *Total Interest* 

<!-- ROADMAP -->
